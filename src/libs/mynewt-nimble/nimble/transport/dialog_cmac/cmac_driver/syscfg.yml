    CMAC_MBOX_SIZE_S2C:
        description: >
            Size of mailbox for SYS to CMAC data. The size
            value should be power of 2 to allow for better
            code optimization.
        value: 128

            Size of mailbox for CMAC to SYS data. The size
            value should be power of 2 to allow for better
            code optimization.
        value: 128

    CMAC_TRIM_SIZE_RFCU:
        description: >
            Size of trim values for RFCU. This is maximum
            number of trim values that can be read from
            OTP and applied, all excessive values will be
            discarded.
        value: 10
    CMAC_TRIM_SIZE_SYNTH:
        description: >
            Size of trim values for RFCU. This is maximum
            number of trim values that can be read from

            Enable CMAC SWD interface.
        value: 0
    CMAC_DEBUG_DIAG_ENABLE:
        description: >
            Enable CMAC diagnostic lines.
        value: 0
    CMAC_DEBUG_DATA_ENABLE:
        description: >
            Enable extra debugging data in shared segment.
        value: 0
    CMAC_DEBUG_COREDUMP_ENABLE:
        description: >
            Enable dumping CMAC registers to shared segment
            on fault.
        value: 1
    CMAC_DEBUG_HOST_PRINT_ENABLE:
        description: >
            Enable some debug printouts to console from host side.
            This will dump some settings during startup, useful to
            check what is loaded to CMAC via shared data.
        value: 0

    CMAC_IMAGE_SINGLE:
        description: >
            When enable, CMAC binary is linked with application image
            creating a single image build. See CMAC_IMAGE_TARGET_NAME.
            When disabled, CMAC binary is built and flashed separately
            to flash partition. See CMAC_IMAGE_PARTITION.
        value: 1
    CMAC_IMAGE_TARGET_NAME:
        description: >
            Target name to build for CMAC binary for single image build.
        value: "@apache-mynewt-nimble/targets/dialog_cmac"
    CMAC_IMAGE_PARTITION:
        description: >
            Flash partition to load CMAC binary from if single image build
            is disabled.
        value: FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_1
    CMAC_IMAGE_RAM_SIZE:
        description: >
            Size of RAM area in bytes reserved for CMAC if single image
            build is disabled. Unit suffix (K, M) is allowed.
            Note: for single image build this setting is not applicable
            since proper RAM area size is automatically calculated from
            CMAC binary.
        value: 128K

    CMAC_CMAC2SYS_IRQ_PRIORITY:
        description: >
            The priority of the CMAC2SYS IRQ. Default is 0, or highest
            priority.
        value: 0
