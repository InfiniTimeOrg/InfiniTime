02/22/20 v1.9.2
Fix compilation on AVR systems.

02/22/20 v1.9.1
Add setArrays() function because of issue #32.
Add API migration info to README and improve README.
Use better sqrtf() approximation.

02/19/20 v1.9.0
Remove deprecated API. Consistent renaming of functions to lowercase.
Make template to be able to use float or double type (float brings a ~70% speed increase on ESP32).
Add option to provide cache for window function weighing factors (~50% speed increase on ESP32).
Add some #defines to enable math approximisations to further speed up code (~40% speed increase on ESP32).

01/27/20 v1.5.5
Lookup table for constants c1 and c2 used during FFT comupting. This increases the FFT computing speed in around 5%.

02/10/18 v1.4
Transition version. Minor optimization to functions. New API. Deprecation of old functions.

12/06/18 v1.3
Add support for mbed development boards.

09/04/17 v1.2.3
Finally solves the issue of Arduino IDE not correctly detecting and highlighting the keywords.

09/03/17 v1.2.2
Solves a format issue in keywords.txt that prevented keywords from being detected.

08/28/17 v1.2.1
Fix to issues 6 and 7. Not cleaning the imaginary vector after each cycle leaded to erroneous calculations and could cause buffer overflows.

08/04/17 v1.2
Fix to bug preventing the number of samples to be greater than 128. New logical limit is 32768 samples but it is bound to the RAM on the chip.

05/12/17 v1.1
Fix issue that prevented installation through the Arduino Library Manager interface.

05/11/17 v1.0
Initial commit to Arduino Library Manager.
