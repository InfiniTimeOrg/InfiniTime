/**
 * Different weather events, weather data structures used by {@link WeatherService.h}
 *
 * How to upload events to the timeline?
 *
 * All timeline write payloads are simply CBOR-encoded payloads of the structs described below.
 *
 * All payloads have a mandatory header part and the dynamic part that
 * depends on the event type specified in the header. If you don't,
 * you'll get an error returned. Data is relatively well-validated,
 * so keep in the bounds of the data types given.
 *
 * Write all struct members (CamelCase keys) into a single finite-sized map, and write it to the characteristic.
 * Mind the MTU.
 *
 * How to debug?
 *
 * There's a Screen that you can compile into your firmware that shows currently valid events.
 * You can adapt that to display something else. That part right now is very much work in progress
 * because the exact requirements are not yet known.
 *
 *
 * Implemented based on and other material:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR
 * https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/obscurationtypes
 * http://www.faraim.org/aim/aim-4-03-14-493.html
