      # This workaround fixes the error "unsafe repository (REPO is owned by someone else)".
      # See https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/760 and https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/766
      # The fix in "actions/checkout@v2" was not sufficient as the build process also uses git (to get the current
      # commit hash, for example).
