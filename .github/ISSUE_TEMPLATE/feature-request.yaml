        **Note:** keep in mind that, while InfiniTime is usable, it is still under heavy development and as such it is continuously evolving.
        Some features you want to see implemented might not be compatible with the current state of the project, or might not even be suitable to include *in the firmware* of the watch.

        If this requires features missing from other software (for example a companion app), please take care of opening any relevant feature request over there as well.
