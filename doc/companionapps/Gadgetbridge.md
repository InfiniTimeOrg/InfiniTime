# Integration with Gadgetbridge
[Gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org/) is an Android application that supports many smartwatches and fitness trackers.

The integration of InfiniTime (previously Pinetime-JF) is now merged into the master branch (https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/). Note that the official version is (as of May 2021) is only available on the F-Droid. There is an outdated "unofficial" version on the Play Store that will not work, as it doesn't have InfiniTime support, and is not associated with the GadgetBridge team.

## Features
The following features are implemented:
 - Scanning & detection of Pinetime-JF / InfiniTime
 - Connection / disconnection
 - Notifications
 
## Demo
[This video](https://seafile.codingfield.com/f/0a2920b9d765462385e4/) shows how to scan, connect, send notification (using the debug screen) and disconnect from the Pinetime.
