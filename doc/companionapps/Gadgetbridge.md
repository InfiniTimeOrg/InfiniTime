# Integration with Gadgetbridge
[Gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org/) is an Android application that supports many smartwatches and fitness trackers.

Gadgetbridge supports InfiniTime [starting with version 0.47](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/src/branch/master/CHANGELOG.md). Note that the official version is only available on F-Droid (as of May 2021), and the unofficial fork available on the Play Store is outdated and does not support InfiniTime.

## Demo
[This video](https://seafile.codingfield.com/f/0a2920b9d765462385e4/) shows how to scan, connect, send notification (using the debug screen) and disconnect from the PineTime.
