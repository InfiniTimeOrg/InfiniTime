# Integration with Gadgetbridge
[Gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org/) is an Android application that supports many smartwatches and fitness trackers.

The integration of InfiniTime (previously Pinetime-JF) is now merged into the master branch (https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/) and initial support is available [starting with version 0.47](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/src/branch/master/CHANGELOG.md). Note that the official version is only available on F-Droid (as of May 2021), and the unofficial fork available on the Play Store is outdated and does not support Infinitime.

## Features
The following features are implemented:
 - Scanning & detection of Pinetime-JF / InfiniTime
 - Connection / disconnection
 - Notifications
