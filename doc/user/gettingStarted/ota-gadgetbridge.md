Wait for the transfer to finish. Your PineTime should reset and reboot with the new version of InfiniTime!

Don't forget to **validate** your firmware. In the InfiniTime go to the settings (swipe right, select gear icon) and Firmware option and click **validate**. Otherwise after reboot the previous firmware will be used.
