# How to contribute?

Here are things you can do to help.

- [Report bugs or issues](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/issues/new/choose)
- [Write and improve documentation](#documentation)
- [Fix bugs, add functionalities and improve the code](#how-to-create-a-pull-request)
- Participate in the discussions within issues and PRs. Your feedback is appreciated!
- Review pull requests. Follow the instructions [here](maintainer-guide.md#reviewing-prs)

## Documentation

Documentation might be incomplete,
or not clear enough,
and it is always possible to improve it with better wording, pictures, videos,...
As the documentation is part of the source code,
you can submit changes to the documentation by creating a [pull request](#how-to-create-a-pull-request)

## How to create a pull request?

1. Fork the project, create a [feature branch](branches.md) from develop and give it a short name that explains the topic of your changes
   - Any feature branch should focus on one topic only
2. Make changes in this branch
   - Write code that satisfies the [coding conventions](/doc/coding-convention.md)
   - Test your changes on a PineTime or the [InfiniTime simulator](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniSim)
3. Create a pull request, participate in the discussion and make more changes to the feature branch if necessary

Your contributions are more than welcome!
