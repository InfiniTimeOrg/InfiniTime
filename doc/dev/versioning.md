# Versioning

The versioning of this project is based on [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- The **patch** is incremented when a bug is fixed on a **released** version (most of the time using a **hotfix** branch).
- The **minor** is incremented when a new version with new features is released. It corresponds to a tag of a commit in **main**.
- The **major** should be incremented when a breaking change is made to the application. We still have to define what is a breaking change in the context of this project.
