# Getting started with InfiniTime 1.0.0

On April 22 2021, InfiniTime and Pine64 [announced the release of InfiniTime 1.0.0](https://www.pine64.org/2021/04/22/its-time-infinitime-1-0/) and the availability of PineTime smartwatches as *enthusiast grade end-user product*. This page aims to guide you with your first step with your new PineTime.

## InfiniTime 1.0.0 quick user guide

### Setting the time

By default, InfiniTime starts on the digital watchface. It'll probably display the epoch time (1 Jan 1970, 00:00).

You can sync the time using companion apps.

 - Gadgetbridge automatically synchronizes the time when you connect it to your watch. More information on Gadgetbridge [here](/doc/gettingStarted/ota-gadgetbridge.md)
 - [Sync the time with NRFConnect](/doc/gettingStarted/time-nrfconnect.md)
 - Sync the time with your browser https://hubmartin.github.io/WebBLEWatch/

Since InfiniTime 1.7.0, you can set the time in the settings without needing to use a companion app
