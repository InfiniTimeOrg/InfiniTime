Wait for the transfer to finish. There will be a progress bar on both the watch and the phone. Your PineTime should reboot with the new version of InfiniTime!

Don't forget to **validate** your firmware. In the InfiniTime go to the settings (swipe right, select gear icon) and scroll to the Firmware option and click **validate**. Otherwise, after reboot the previous firmware will be used.
