## InfiniTime releases and versions
All releases of InfiniTime are available on the [release page of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/releases).

Versions that are tagged as **RELEASE CANDIDATE** are pre-release versions, that are available for testing before actually releasing a new stable version. If you want to help us debug the project and provide stable versions to other user, you can use them. If you want stable and tested version, you should not flash these release candidate version.

Release files are available under the *Assets* button.

## How to upgrade Over-The-Air (OTA)
OTA is the easiest method to upgrade InfiniTime. Note that it's only possible is your PineTime is already running InfiniTime (>= 0.7.1).

2 companion apps provide support for OTA : 
 - [Gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org/) (open source, runs on Android, [available on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge/)). 
 - [NRFConnect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile) (close source, runs on Android and iOS).
 
Both applications need you to download the **DFU file** of InfiniTime. This file contains the new version of InfiniTime that will be flashed into your device. It's called **dfu-x.y.z.zip** (ex: dfu-0.9.0.zip) in the release note.

### Using Gadgetbridge
Launch Gadgetbridge and tap on the **"+"** button on the bottom right to add a new device:

![Gadgetbridge 0](gadgetbridge0.jpg)

Wait for the scan to complete, your PineTime should be detected:

![Gadgetbridge 1](gadgetbridge1.jpg)

Tap on it. Gadgdetbridge will pair and connect to your device:

Now that Gadgetbridge is connected to your PineTime, use a file browser application (I'm using Seafile to browse my NAS) and browse to the DFU file (image-xxx.zip) you downloaded previously. Tap on it and open it using the Gadgetbridge application/firmware installer:

Read carefully the warning and tap **Install**:

Tap on the *Connect* button on the right of your device. NRFConnect will connect to your PineTime and discover its characteristics. Tap on the **DFU** button on the top right:

![NRFConnect 1](nrfconnect1.jpg)

Select **Distribution packet (ZIP)**:

![NRFConnect 2](nrfconnect2.jpg)

Browse to the DFU file you downloaded previously, the DFU transfer will start automatically. When the transfer is finished, your PineTime will reset and restart on the new version of InfiniTime!

## How to flash InfiniTime using the SWD interface
Download the files **bootloader.bin**, **image-x.y.z.bin** and **pinetime-graphics-x.y.z.bin** from the release page:

![Image file](imageFile.png )

The bootloader reads a boot logo from the external SPI flash memory. The first step consists in flashing a tool in the MCU that will flash the boot logo into this SPI flash memory. This first step is optional but recommanded (the bootloader will display garbage on screen for a few second if you don't do it).
Using your SWD tool, flash **pinetime-graphics-x.y.z.bin** at offset **0x0000**. Reset the MCU and wait for a few second, until the logo is completely drawn on the display.

Then, using your SWD tool, flash those file at specific offset:

 - bootloader.bin : **0x0000**
 - image-x.y.z.bin : **0x8000**

Reset and voil√†, you're running InfiniTime on your PineTime!
 
If you are using OpenOCD with a STLinkV2, you can find more info [on this page](../openOCD.md).

## How to synchronize the time

### Using Gadgetbridge
Good news! Gadgetbridge **automatically** synchronizes the time when connecting to your PineTime!

### Using NRFConnect
You must enable the **CTS** *GATT server* into NRFConnect so that InfiniTime can synchronize the time with your smartphone.

Launch NRFConnect, tap the sandwich button on the top left and select *Configure GATT server*:

Tap *Add service* and select the server configuration *Current Time service*. Tap OK and connect to your PineTime, it should automcatically sync the time once the connection is established!
