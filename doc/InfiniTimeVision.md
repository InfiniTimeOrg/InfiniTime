# InfiniTime Vision

The purpose of this document is to steer efforts towards a common goal, and as such should be taken into consideration with all developments.

## InfiniTime

InfiniTime is a community-built smartwatch firmware.
It offers freedom and privacy advantages unavailable to users of proprietary wearable technology.

InfiniTime is not to be used for medical or other health tracking purposes.

## Core Principles

- Keep It Simple
- Reliability
- Battery efficiency
- Easy and simple navigation
- Behaviour should be predictable and easy to understand
- Prefer solid default experience over customization
- Personalization is achieved through custom watch faces.
  More options may be available through a companion app.
- Use standard protocols and methods

## Long term vision

The perfect version of InfiniTime would include:

- Capability to sideload apps and watch faces
- Only a minimal feature set in the flashed firmware.
  Users would add the features they want.
- Ports to other devices
- Translations
- Great user documentation
